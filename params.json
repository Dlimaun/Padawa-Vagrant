It will download and install all you needs using just shell scripts.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\nYou will need to install these tools.\r\n* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)\r\n* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nIs your first time using vagrant? It's so simple you just need to run `vagrant up`. Just remember to be on same directory of Vagrantfile.\r\nIt would be like that:\r\n    \r\n    host$ git clone https://github.com/Dlimaun/padawan-vagrant.git\r\n    host$ cd padawan-vagrant`\r\n    host$ vagrant up\r\n\r\nYour virtual machine is running! \\o/\r\nLet's access it with:\r\n\r\n    host$ vagrant ssh\r\n\r\n## What's installed\r\nThere's nothing preinstalled you will select what you need.\r\nOpen the `Vagrantfile` and change the variables on top of the file, mark `true` on what you want to be installed.\r\nThere are scripts to install that below but you can add yours too!\r\n* [Java 8](http://java.com/)\r\n* [MongoDB 3](https://www.mongodb.org)\r\n* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)\r\n* [Apache Tomcat 8](http://tomcat.apache.org/)\r\n\r\n## Useful Comands\r\nYou need to know some commands to use vagrant\r\n\r\n    host$ vagrant suspend\r\nThis command save the current state of the machine and then stops it. Is useful when you want to continue what you're doing later. This will make your machine start super fast on next `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\n    host$ vagrant halt\r\nThis command realy shutdown the machine. Means that the current state isn't saved. This method don't save the machine ram on disk like the `vagrant suspend`, but consumes extra disk space.\r\n\r\n    host$ vagrant destroy\r\nThis command you clear you disk, removing all everything from your guest machine. Be careful.\r\n\r\n    host$ vagrant login\r\n    host$ vagrant share\r\nI recommend you to use this command to share your box with others. When you use vagrant you will download the *\"brute\" OS* and then install all you want using provisionning tools, but that isn't the fast way to share your box because your machine have to download everything after install the *OS*. So when your box is configured share with your team members. You'll need to create a acount on [HashiCorp's Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/account/new).\r\n\r\n    host$ vagrant provision\r\nThis command will rerun provision scripts. You can select which script you will want using `--provision-with=<name>` where `<name>` is the name of you provision script.\r\n\r\n## Inspiration and Thanks\r\nThis project is inspired by [Minotauro Vagrant Rails](https://github.com/pragmaticivan/minotauro_vagrant_rails) which is a virtual machine for Ruby on Rails Application Development.\r\n\r\nThanks to [Rachid Calazans](https://github.com/rachidcalazans) and [Danilo Alcoforado]()\r\n\r\n## Future and improvements\r\nOn future I want to put others scripts.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help by adding a new script or anything else [Create a issue](https://github.com/Dlimaun/Padawan-Vagrant/issues/new).\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
